/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */




//The abstracts/ folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. 
//Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

//The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. 
//These are nothing but Sass helpers.

@import 
    'abstracts/variables',
    'abstracts/functions',
    'abstracts/mixins';


//The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. 
//In there, you might find the reset file, some typographic rules, 
//and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements (that I like to call _base.scss).
@import 
    'base/base',
    'base/reset',
    'base/typography';

//The layout/ folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application.
//This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar…), 
//the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.


@import

    'layout/grid',
    'layout/header',
    'layout/footer',
    'layout/sidebar',

//For smaller components, there is the components/ folder. While layout/ is macro (defining the global wireframe),
//components/ is more focused on widgets.
// It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. 
//There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.


@import 
    'components/buttons',
    'components/carousel',
    'components/slider',
    'components/cover',
    'components/dropdown';

//If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a pages/ folder, in a file named after the page. 
//For instance, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a _home.scss file in pages/.

@import 
    'pages/homepage',
    'pages/login';

//On large sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes. 
//There are certainly different ways of dealing with themes but I personally like having them all in a themes/ folder.

@import 
    'themes/theme',
    'themes/admin';

// @import 'vendors/bootstrap';
// @import 'vendors/jquery-ui';




/* If your project uses a lot of CSS animations, you might consider adding an \_animations.scss file in there 
containing the @keyframes definitions of all your animations. */
